  In order to test account transaction I create a new transaction with the moderator nhomar
-
  !context
    uid: 'base_community.user_nhomar'
-
  !record {model: account.wallet.transaction, id: transaction_test_1}:
    sender_id: partner_test1
    receiver_id: partner_test2
    description: 'Test transaction between users'
    currency_ids:
      - model: "account.wallet.transaction"
        field: "currency_ids"
        price_unit: 100
        currency_id: COM
-
  I check that nhomar can confirm it
-
  !python {model: account.wallet.transaction}: |
    self.confirm(cr, uid, [ref('transaction_test_1')])
-
  !assert {model: account.wallet.transaction, id: transaction_test_1, string: "Nhomar wasn't able to confirm the transaction, or the confirm state wasn't skipped!"}:
    - state == 'done'
-
  I check that a reservation transaction was made
-
  !assert {model: account.wallet.transaction, id: transaction_test_1, string: "No reservation transaction was made"}:
    - reservation_id.id != False
-
  I check that a payment transaction was made
-
  !assert {model: account.wallet.transaction, id: transaction_test_1, string: "No payment transaction was made"}:
    - payment_id.id != False

  I check that nhomar can cancel it
-
  !python {model: account.wallet.transaction}: |
    self.reset_workflow(cr, uid, [ref('transaction_test_1')])
-
  !assert {model: account.wallet.transaction, id: transaction_test_1, string: "Nhomar wasn't able to cancel the transaction, or the confirm refund state wasn't skipped!"}:
    - state == 'cancel'
-
  I check that the reservation transaction is cancelled
-
  !assert {model: account.wallet.transaction, id: transaction_test_1, string: "The reservation transaction is still here!"}:
    - reservation_id.id == False
-
  I check that a payment transaction is cancelled
-
  !assert {model: account.wallet.transaction, id: transaction_test_1, string: "The payment transaction is still here!"}:
    - payment_id.id == False
